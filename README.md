This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Built using [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com)

## Some note

- I'm just using at lease dependencies as I can to keep this project as simple as possible. So I'm not adding Redux, Redux Saga or Redux Thunk for this kind of project.
- It took me about 2-3 hours to set everything up and finish the project cuz I just do this in my working time so it could be a little bit too simple.
- And thanks you for giving me this change and sorry if I disappoint you.
